Wish I could forget how it felt
When you said that it's over
Staring at your lipstick
On the wineglass by the sofa
Had the same fight twenty times in a night
I regret that
It's not the first time that you left
It's the first time you didn't come back
It's how I spend my days
It's all I think about
This ain't a dream
I'm stuck in a nightmare
Get me out
*
Cause I'm broken
Ain't nobody gonna fix me
And I'm choking
On the pictures and the memories
Every time I do it to myself
Never seem to learn I'm crying for help
Cause I'm broken
Ain't nobody gonna fix me
Yea you broke me into tiny pieces
I can see the ghost of your headlights
Fade as you drive away
Took the one thing that I can't live without
For a single day
Had the same fight twenty times in a night
I regret that
It's not the first time that I've prayed
It's the first time I prayed you'd come back
*Repeat
Yea you broke me into tiny pieces
It's how I spent my days
It's all I think about
This ain't a dream
I'm stuck in a nightmare
Get me out
*Repeat
You broke me into tiny pieces
Yea you broke me into tiny pieces
