Broken Down in Tiny Pieces
Love isn't really all that much
Just a song you used to whisper
Or a smile I tried to touch

Broken down in tiny pieces
Love is hardly worth the time
Just a nickel that I borrowed
For a dream that cost a dime

Take me back to where we started
You can help me mend
Here I am in tiny pieces
Please put me back together again

Broken down in tiny pieces
Love's a special kind of thing
A snowball in December
You remember in the Spring

And you were all that I remember
Of the things I tried to find
In between the broken pieces
You keep running through my mind

Can't you see I'll always love you
It will never end
Here I am in tiny pieces
Please put me back together again.
