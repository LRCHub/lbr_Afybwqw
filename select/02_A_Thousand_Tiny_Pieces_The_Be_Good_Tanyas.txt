Just play this one out until it explodes into a thousand tiny pieces
What's your story, universe, you are melody in numbers
You are shapes, you are rhythms, there are signs that we can learn
To place over the heavens, to predict how long we'll burn
How long will I last, can I turn up the heat?
What star am I circling, what's circling me?
Now my ebb and my flow, my lack of control,
Turning on, turning off
Saying yes, but playing no.
(Guitar solo)
Things keep changing
(Instrumental)
Just play this one out until it explodes into a thousand tiny pieces,
What's your story, universe, you are melody in numbers
You are shapes, you are rhythms, there are signs that we can learn,
To place over the heavens, to predict how long we'll burn
How long will I last, can I turn up the heat?
What star am I circling, what's circling me?
Now my ebb and my flow, my lack of control,
Turning on, turning off
